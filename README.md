Midterm project for CS567 (Topics in Computer Graphics) at Western Illinois University

# Endless Quest
Endless is a game prototype developed using the XNA framework with Microsoft Visual Studio. The game is a infinite runner with elements of RPG.
The player's goal is to try to get as far as possible with its character. The only aspects that the player can control are the
abilities that its character may use to defear enemies and overcome obstacles.

# Screen

# Development
The game currently has a menu screen where the player can select its character's class. Only the basic level is functional, with
some enemies prototypes (Goombas from the Super Mario franchise) that can be defeated.

# TODO
There are several points that must be developed for the game:

- Development of each class (weapons, abilities, and armor)
- Enemies and bosses
- Add more levels
- Add obstacles
